* number of small code refactor/cleanups
* fixed rulers in simulator
* new thread for initialization; new thread for machine status
* added MRU cache and "recent" menu
* adding prominent status bar to main window with driver/machine/connection information
* adding check for v0002 firmware in 3rd-generation driver startup

0003 ReplicatorG

* created RepRap 3rd generation driver
* fixed various bugs with serial port handling
* fixed various bugs with threading, etc.
* added support for PWM/RPM motor speeds
* tweaked the build process quite a bit for mac / linux / windows.
* added more build status information
* created a modular configuration for various toolheads
* bundled skeinforge for toolpath generation.

0002 ReplicatorG

* add units to simulation window

* move to a controller/model/driver system.
* Add an extruder section (temp, start/stop extruder, extruder direction, extruder speed)
* added text boxes to control/display feedrate data
* fix shutdown of driver
* fix windows icons

0001 Replicatorg

* convert .pde to .gcode
* get GUI working reliably
* create gcode running thread
* create gcode simulation thread
* create gcode simulation driver
* get text-highlighting up and running
* get machine driver-loading based on XML
* update RunButtonWatcher to work with our running and/or simulating thread (obsolete)
* move percentage / line count to bottom of window.
* remove HandleNewLibrary
* change 'Run' to 'Build'
* get help menu up and running properly (send everyone to website)
* add our ReplicatorG header to every file
* implement support for various gcode pauses / prompts / etc.
* change message dialog to yes/no dialog that allows you to cancel the operation
* test build process on linux
* test serialpassthrough driver
* add simple simulation window
* reformat GUI with different button ordering
* create and add 'pause' button
* update 'build' button graphic to be rotated 90 deg.
* add support for rest of low-hanging m codes
* finish implementation of ToolDrivers
* add a processing driver to calculate build time, look for errors, etc.
* finish gcode parsing for proper coordinates / machine status / etc.
* change colors to RepRap green (thanks nick bilton!)
* add elapsed time to build process
* add confirmation alert after print finishes
* add dispose after print finish
* update serialpassthroughdriver to pull all config from XML file
* update nulldriver to pull more config from XML file
* tweak play / pause button behavior
* get multi-print working solidly
