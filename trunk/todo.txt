0003 ReplicatorG

* windows not using proper com## port from preferences.
* get auto-formatting working
* add support for slice/dice plugins (skeinforge?  reprap?)
* Have two buttons for each axis (fast and slow movement)
* re-add 'gcode' console.
* start work on next generation driver for arduino / sanguino w/ point queueing, etc.
* experiment with SNAP driver?
* add direction lines to simulation lines
* While holding a button -> continuous movement (a bit cumbersome to implement perhaps)
* Add a "Reference" button (home to reference position)
* For reference and home functions; have an option for ignoring the Z axis
* Support for cancelling a temperature or goto home job (this is also a bit hard since these are blocking on the Arduino; would be cool to have a way of doing this in the firmware)
* add variable line width to 2D simulation based on extruder on/off state.
* refactor ControlPanel to not be so gigantic when creating control panel
* add time elapsed / total time to build window
* add temperature, etc. to build window, especially important while heating.

0004 ReplicatorG

* add support for adding STL to sketch (for slicing)
* add STL 3D preview
* add simulation 3D preview (with 2D option as well)

000X ReplicatorG

* Highlight the currently executing line in addition to the currently queued line
* Look into using log4j for debug and output logging
* The control panel's jog dialog should always operate in relative mode.
* SerialPassthroughDriver: Option for setInitialized(true vs. false) -> machines.xml?
* Batch jobs (print the same object multiple times, or multiple objects in one go)
* Support pause (stop extruder, move head away) and continue
* Calibration mode (especially to find zero z and write it back to machines.xml)
* Simulator windows for previous jobs is still visible.
* Look into how we can give the JVM process more priority
* Add Application logo on Mac, also when launching from Eclipse?
* Ignore the simluator preference setting when operating in pure simulator mode
