0002 ReplicatorG

TODO:
* fix windows icons
* fix startup/shutdown of driver

DONE:
* add units to simulation window
* add proper bounds to simulation window
* add warmup/cooldown to machine config
* add simple exerciser / status window
* add color to simulation window
* add up/down arrows to simulation windows
* implement Peter Edworthy ideas on driver instantiation
* have simulation move to a proportional wait time
* fix build time estimation
* add estimate menu item
* add basic machine configuration stuff to XML (axes, resolution, extruders, toolheads, clamps, etc.)
* move to a controller/model/driver system.
* Add an extruder section (temp, start/stop extruder, extruder direction, extruder speed)
* added text boxes to control/display feedrate data

0003 ReplicatorG and beyond

* get auto-formatting working
* add support for adding STL to sketch (for slicing)
* add STL 3D preview
* add simulation 3D preview (with 2D option as well)
* add support for slice/dice plugins (skeinforge?  reprap?)
* Have two buttons for each axis (fast and slow movement)
* re-add 'gcode' console.
* start work on next generation driver for arduino / sanguino w/ point queueing, etc.
* experiment with SNAP driver?
* add direction lines to simulation lines
* While holding a button -> continuous movement (a bit cumbersome to implement perhaps)
* Add a "Reference" button (home to reference position)
* For reference and home functions; have an option for ignoring the Z axis
* Support for cancelling a temperature or goto home job (this is also a bit hard since these are blocking on the Arduino; would be cool to have a way of doing this in the firmware)
* add variable line width to 2D simulation based on extruder on/off state.
* refactor ControlPanel to not be so gigantic when creating control panel
* add time elapsed / total time to build window
* add temperature, etc. to build window.
