0003 ReplicatorG

* maximum and default feedrate values in control panel based on prefs
* windows not using proper com## port from preferences.
* get auto-formatting working
* add support for slice/dice plugins (skeinforge?  reprap?)
* Have two buttons for each axis (fast and slow movement)
* re-add 'gcode' console.
* start work on next generation driver for arduino / sanguino w/ point queueing, etc.
* experiment with SNAP driver?
* add direction lines to simulation lines
* While holding a button -> continuous movement (a bit cumbersome to implement perhaps)
* Add a "Reference" button (home to reference position)
* For reference and home functions; have an option for ignoring the Z axis
* Support for cancelling a temperature or goto home job (this is also a bit hard since these are blocking on the Arduino; would be cool to have a way of doing this in the firmware)
* add variable line width to 2D simulation based on extruder on/off state.
* refactor ControlPanel to not be so gigantic when creating control panel
* add time elapsed / total time to build window
* add temperature, etc. to build window, especially important while heating.

0004 ReplicatorG

* add support for adding STL to sketch (for slicing)
* add STL 3D preview
* add simulation 3D preview (with 2D option as well)

000X ReplicatorG

* Highlight the currently executing line in addition to the currently queued line
* Don't busy-loop waiting for serial in SerialPassthroughDriver (CPU usage)
* Look into using log4j for debug and output logging
* The control panel window creates a few threads which are not shut down on exit.
  This causes serial communication to keep going on after the port has closed.
* The control panel's jog dialog should always operate in relative mode.
* Look into syncing core with Processing.
* SerialPassthroughDriver: Option for setInitialized(true vs. false) -> machines.xml?
* Look into making serial response handled asynchronously/event driven (check Processing and Arduino for ideas or updates to core code).
